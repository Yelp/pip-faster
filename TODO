# Things that I want to do, but would put me past my deadline:

* I could remove the --cov-config with a small patch to pytest-cov
    use os.path.abspath(options.cov_config) in postprocess(options)

* coverage.py adds some helpful warnings to stderr, with no way to quiet them.
    there's already an issue (#2 i think?), just needs a patch

* pytest-timeout won't actually time-out with floating-point, zero, or negative input
